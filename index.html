                <p>Following natural disasters like a hurricane or earthquake, many people rely on the generosity of
                    strangers to help rebuild their lives. Donations to disaster relief organizations, local food and
                    diaper
                    banks, and other charities can make a big difference to people in great need.

                    However, we know that not everyone who can donate to these organizations ends up opening their
                    wallets.
                    In fact, a phenomenon known as compassion collapse (or fade) can make people less generous following
                    catastrophic situations—or any time we are faced with many people in need.</p>
